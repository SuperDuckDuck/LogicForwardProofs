lemma "(( A \<longrightarrow> B) \<longrightarrow> A) \<longrightarrow> A" 
proof - 
{
  assume "(A \<longrightarrow> B) \<longrightarrow> A"
  {
    assume a:"\<not>A"
    {
      assume A
      with a have B by contradiction
    }
    hence "A \<longrightarrow> B" by (rule impI)
    with \<open>(A \<longrightarrow> B) \<longrightarrow> A\<close> have A by (rule impE)
    with \<open>\<not>A\<close> have False by contradiction
  }
  hence "\<not>\<not>A" by (rule notI)
  hence A by (rule notnotD)
